# Quickstart: Enroll Intune devices into Endpoint analytics

This quickstart outlines prerequisites and instructions for enrolling Intune managed devices into Endpoint analytics. If your devices are co-managed and meet the [Intune device requirements](#bkmk_prereq) below, we recommend using the instructions in this quickstart to enroll them to Endpoint analytics via Intune. Note that you do not need to move any co-management workloads to Intune to enroll eligible devices via Intune.

## <a name="bkmk_prereq"></a> Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:  

### Intune device requirements

- Intune enrolled or co-managed devices running Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro Education, Windows 10 Enterprise, or Windows 10 Education. Windows 10 Home isn't supported.
   - Startup performance insights are only available for devices running version 1903 or later of Windows 10 Enterprise, Education, or Pro. Windows 10 long-term servicing channel (LTSC) isn't supported.
      -  Windows 10 Pro versions 1903 and 1909 require [KB4577062](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4577062/windows-10-update-kb4577062). <!--8392089, 8389021-->
      - Windows 10 Pro versions 2004 and 20H2 require [KB4577063](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4577063/windows-10-update-kb4577063). <!--8392089, 8389021-->

- The **Connected User Experiences and Telemetry** service on the device is running

### <a name="bkmk_endpoints"></a> Endpoints required for Intune-managed devices

To enroll devices to Endpoint analytics, they need to send required functional data to Microsoft public cloud. Endpoint Analytics uses the Windows 10 and Windows Server **Connected User Experiences and Telemetry** component (DiagTrack) to collect the data from Intune-managed devices.

| Endpoint  | Function  |
|-----------|-----------|
| `https://*.events.data.microsoft.com` | Used by Intune-managed devices to send [required functional data](data-collection.md#bkmk_datacollection) to the Intune data collection endpoint. |

### Licensing Prerequisites

Endpoint analytics is included in the following plans:

- [Enterprise Mobility + Security E3](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/ProductResults.aspx?doc=Product%20Terms,OST&fid=51) or higher
- [Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise?rtc=1) or higher.

### Endpoint analytics permissions

- The [Intune Service Administrator role](../intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control.md) is required to [start gathering data](#bkmk_onboard).
   - After clicking **Start** for gathering data, other read-only roles can view the data.

[!INCLUDE [Endpoint analytics permissions information](includes/endpoint-analytics-rbac.md)]

## <a name="bkmk_onboard"></a> Onboard in the Endpoint analytics portal
Onboarding from  the Endpoint analytics portal is required for Intune managed devices. For more information about common issues, see [Troubleshooting device enrollment and startup performance](troubleshoot.md#bkmk_enrollment_tshooter).

[!INCLUDE [Endpoint analytics overview page information](includes/onboard.md)]

## <a name="bkmk_view"></a> View the Overview page

You won't see your data immediately. The data needs to be gathered and the results calculated. For startup performance, the device needs to have been restarted at least once. Once your data is ready, you'll notice some information on the **Overview** page, explained in more detail below:
