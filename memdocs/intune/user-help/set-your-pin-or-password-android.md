# Set your PIN or password

Your company support might require you to set a PIN or password on your Android device when you're using Intune to access your work or school data. You might also see messages that require you to make your PIN or password longer or more complex so that it's more secure. These passcodes are used, for example, to access your device from the lock screen.

You can use the following steps to set a PIN or password.

1. Tap  **Settings** > **Security** > **Screen Lock** > **Password**.

2. Choose and confirm your new password.

On certain devices, you must create a startup PIN *and* a lock screen password. You can configure Secure Startup from the Settings app on your device. On the Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, go to **Settings** > **Lock Screen and Security** > **Secure Startup**. For more information about setting up your device securely with encryption, see [Device encrypted but apps say otherwise](your-device-appears-encrypted-but-cp-says-otherwise-android.md). 

Still need help? Contact your support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
