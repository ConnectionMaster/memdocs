Some apps contain harmful behavior and can compromise the data on your device. To prevent these types of apps from harming your device, we recommend that you: 

* Only download apps from verified sources, such as the Google Play Store.  
* Turn on Google Play Protect. Play Protect checks the apps on your device and alerts you to security threats.  

Complete the following steps to turn on Play Protect.  

1. Go to the **Settings** app and tap > **Biometrics and security**.
2. Tap **Google Play Protect**.
3. Tap **Turn on**.
