# Check compliance on your iOS device  
Manually start a device check-in from the Company Portal to:

* Update your device settings status 
* Regain access to your work or school resources 

Company Portal regularly checks in with your device, but you can start a check-in anytime from the app.  During a check-in, Company Portal confirms that the settings on your device meet your organization's policy requirements. Your organization can limit or restrict access to work or school resources until you check in.  

If you recently made changes to your device settings, you may need to manually check in to register these changes with Company Portal. 

1. Open the Company Portal app for iOS on your device.  

2. Tap **Device** and then select your device.  

3. Tap **Check status**. Company Portal will check your device to confirm that it's meeting your organization's policy requirements. Once the check is complete, the device settings status will tell you if you have access to company resources.
